# Quote Viewer

This project is meant as a demonstration of skills and knowledge from WidesðŸŽ¸, the self taught
developer, mediocre philosopher, ugly bard, and village idiot...

This project is intended to showcase basic usage of an external API for data
fetching to then display for the user in an aesthetically pleasant manor. Quotes will be
randomly requested 1 per to limit API calls.

Just a small point of clarity, its named QuoteGoats caused I like the rhyme, eh, im weird...
